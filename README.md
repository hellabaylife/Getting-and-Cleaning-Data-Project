# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project Created by - Hellabaylife

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

I am using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository linked below:
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

The files within this project are as follows:

1: Codebook.md that contains detailed descriptions of all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

2: run_analysis.R that:

        1st: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

        2nd: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

        3rd: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

        4th: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

        5th: From the data set created at the end of the 4th step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each           variable   for each activity and each subject.

3: FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
